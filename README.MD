# VEGAN MEMORY GAME
This project is based on the children’s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves they use and a timer to determin how long to complete the game.

# Reflection
This is a larger scale project silimilar to my final project I did with my coach Gillian through the Get Coding Program. 
Learning from Gillian was a great experience and I found her helpful and always leading an ear to help me solve most of my issues. Some thing I struggled with were flipping the cards back once clicked if not a match and shuffling the cards. 
Javascript challenged me in many ways to think outside the box. She mentioned I should make the game larger, as a way to keep working on my JavaScript.
I enjoyed putting this project together, seeing the final result and showing my family and friends.

I decided to honour Pride month in our province (June) with a Pride theme. 
This project is based on the children’s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves they use and a timer to determin how long to complete the game. 
If the player successfully matches all of the cards, a “win” message is displayed with how many moves and how long you took to win!
