# VEGAN MEMORY GAME
This project is based on the childrenâ€™s card game, where the player tries to match pairs of cards that are flipped over. The player is shown how many moves they use and a timer to determin how long to complete the game.

# Reflection
This is a larger scale project silimilar to my final project I did with my coach Gillian through the Get Coding Program. 
Learning from Gillian was a great experience and I found her helpful and always leading an ear to help me solve most of my issues. Some thing I struggled with were flipping the cards back once clicked if not a match and shuffling the cards. 
Javascript challenged me in many ways to think outside the box. She mentioned I should make the game larger, as a way to keep working on my JavaScript.
I enjoyed putting this project together, seeing the final result and showing my family and friends.
